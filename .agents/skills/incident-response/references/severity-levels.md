## Severity Decision Tree

```
Is there data loss or security breach?
├─ Yes → SEV1
└─ No → Is the service completely unavailable?
        ├─ Yes → SEV1
        └─ No → Are >50% of users affected?
                ├─ Yes → SEV2
                └─ No → Are >10% of users affected?
                        ├─ Yes → SEV3
                        └─ No → Is there a workaround?
                                ├─ No → SEV3
                                └─ Yes → SEV4
```

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate severity UP when:

- Duration exceeds expected resolution time
- Impact spreading to more users/services
- Mitigation attempts failing
- Additional symptoms appearing
- Customer complaints increasing

Escalate severity DOWN when:

- Workaround identified and working
- Impact contained to smaller scope
- Partial mitigation successful
- Root cause identified with fix in progress

## Response Time SLAs

| Severity | Acknowledge | First Update | Resolution Target |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| SEV1     | 5 min       | 15 min       | ASAP (no target)  |
| SEV2     | 15 min      | 30 min       | 4 hours           |
| SEV3     | 1 hour      | 2 hours      | 24 hours          |
| SEV4     | 8 hours     | Next day     | 1 week            |
